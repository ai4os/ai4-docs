ğŸš€ Upcoming features
--------------------

In this section, we will offer some insight on to where the AI4OS stack is heading.

First, the are a number of mature features that are in the process of being integrated
in the stack:

* ğŸ“ˆ try model endpoints with OSCAR
* ğŸ“ˆ new tool for efficient video streaming (Kafka)
* ğŸ“ˆ support for federated learning with NVflare

Along with these upcoming features, we are exploring more improvements. These are
in an experimental status and might not finally get integrated in the stack.

* ğŸ“ˆ carbon footprint estimator for your deployments
* ğŸ“ˆ graph visualizations of your module/deployment metadata
* ğŸ“ˆ ability to launch trainings in batch
* ğŸ“ˆ new popularity metrics
