DEEPaaS API
===========

The `DEEPaaS API <https://github.com/ai4os/DEEPaaS>`__ enables a user friendly interaction with the underlying Deep
Learning modules and can be used both for training models and doing inference with services.
It provides some common methods to query all the modules in the Marketplace.

For a detailed up-to-date documentation please refer to the `official DEEPaaS documentation <https://docs.ai4eosc.eu/projects/deepaas/en/stable/>`_.


.. _deepaas-integrate:

Integrate your model with the API
---------------------------------

The best approach to integrate your code with DEEPaaS is to create an empty template
using the :doc:`AI4OS Modules Template </reference/cookiecutter-template>`.
This will take care of creating a Python package of your model with all the appropriate
structure for your model (entrypoints, files, etc).

Once the template is created, install the package in editable mode and move your existing
code (if any) it.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -e .

To define the API methods that will interface with your existing code, we have to
modify the ``api.py`` file.
The `API methods <https://docs.ai4eosc.eu/projects/deepaas/en/stable/user/v2-api.html>`__
methods you can define are:

* **Enable prediction**: implement ``get_predict_args()`` and ``predict()``.
* **Enable training**: implement ``get_train_args()`` and ``train()``.
* **Enable model weights preloading**: implement ``warm()``.

You don't need to define all the methods, just the ones you need.
Every other method will return a ``NotImplementError`` when  queried from the API.
The ``get_metadata()`` should be already defined for you.

If you don't feel like reading the DEEPaaS docs (which you should), we recommend taking
a look at the `AI4OS demo app <https://github.com/ai4os-hub/ai4os-demo-app/blob/master/ai4os_demo_app/api.py>`__.
There, you will be able to see examples on:

* how to define you predict function, with multiple types of inputs and outputs.
* how to choose to return different formats, be it a JSON or a file (eg. image, zip).
  If you choose to return a JSON, please define a ``schema`` to validate the output predictions.
* how to define a training function that logs metrics into Tensorboard monitoring.

.. dropdown:: ã…¤ ðŸ§  Decoupling code and API

    Try to keep you module's code as decoupled as possible from DEEPaaS code, so that
    any future changes in the API are easy to integrate.
    This means that the ``predict()`` in ``api.py`` should mostly be an interface to
    your true predict function. In pseudocode:

    .. code-block:: python

        #api.py
        import utils  # eg. this is where your true predict function is

        def predict(**kwargs):
            args = preprocess(kwargs)  # transform deepaas input to your standard input
            out = utils.predict(args)  # make prediction
            resp = postprocess(out)    # transform your standard output to deepaas output
            return resp


.. _deepaas_considerations:

Additional considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The values you use in your ``get_predict_args()`` will be used to generate the Gradio UI in :doc:`Try-me deployments </howtos/try/dashboard-gradio>`.

In particular, this affects to how files (``webargs.fields.Field``) will be rendered in the UI:

* if ``image`` is found in description, it will be rendered as a Gradio image
* if ``audio`` is found in description, it will be rendered as a Gradio audio
* if ``video`` is found in description, it will be rendered as a Gradio video
* if ``#noparse`` is found in description, it will be rendered as a Gradio generic file
* if more than one is found in description (eg. ``image`` and ``video``), it will be rendered as a Gradio generic file
* if no keyword is found, it will be rendered as a Gradio generic file

.. code-block:: python

    def get_predict_args():
        arg_dict = {
            "demo_image": fields.Field(
                required=True,
                type="file",
                location="form",
                description="test upload",
                # "image" not in description, thus rendered as a generic file in the Gradio UI
            ),
            "demo_image_1": fields.Field(
                required=True,
                type="file",
                location="form",
                description="test image upload",
                # "image" is indeed in description, thus rendered as an image in the Gradio UI
            ),
        }
        return arg_dict

In addition, if you have not defined a ``schema`` to validate your JSON response, the output in the UI will be the plain JSON response, instead of a feature-rich UI.
The same point about rendering files also applies here.

.. code-block:: python

    schema = {
        "demo_image_2": fields.Str(
            description="some file"
        ), # "image" not in description, thus rendered as a generic file in the Gradio UI
        "demo_image_3": fields.Str(
            description="some image file"
        ), # "image" is indeed in description, thus rendered as an image in the Gradio UI
        "accept": fields.Str(),
    }


Running the API
---------------

To start the API run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deepaas-run --listen-ip 0.0.0.0

and go to http://0.0.0.0:5000/ui. You will see the Swagger UI with all the methods:

.. image:: /_static/images/endpoints/deepaas.png
   :width: 500 px

If running the API from inside a module's Docker container, you can use the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deep-start --deepaas
