User access levels
==================

Currently we offer two user access levels. Depending how you :doc:`register </getting-started/register>`, you
will have access to different services.


.. _authentication_basic:

Basic access level
------------------

This access level will allow you to use some basic features like:

* :doc:`Try a model in the Dashboard </howtos/try/index>`
* :doc:`Deploy a model in your own cloud </howtos/deploy/cloud>`
* :doc:`Chat with the AI4OS LLM </reference/llm>`

This access level is granted to any :doc:`registered user </getting-started/register>`.

Full access level
------------------

This access level will allow you to use all the features the AI4OS stack has to offer, including:

* :doc:`Developing a model in the Dashboard </howtos/develop/index>`
* :doc:`Training a model in the Dashboard </howtos/train/index>`
* :doc:`Deploying a model in production </howtos/deploy/index>`
* :doc:`Accessing the AI4OS storage </reference/storage>`

This access level is usually reserved to members of one of the following projects:

* `AI4EOSC <https://ai4eosc.eu/>`__: AI for the European Open Science Cloud
* `iMagine <https://imagine-ai.eu/>`__: Imaging data and services for aquatic science
* `AI4Life <https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/>`__: AI models and methods for the life sciences

Upgrading your access level
---------------------------

Any user with basic access level is, in principle, candidate to upgrade to full access.
There are two main entrypoints to full access:

Option 1. Join a supported project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Members of the following projects get full access level:

* `AI4EOSC <https://ai4eosc.eu/>`__: AI for the European Open Science Cloud
* `iMagine <https://imagine-ai.eu/>`__: Imaging data and services for aquatic science
* `AI4Life <https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/>`__: AI models and methods for the life sciences

Consider joining these projects via their *Open calls for external usecases*.
More information about the calls can be found in their respective project's homepages.

Option 2. Make a special requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes joining a project is a lengthy process.
We are also able to upgrade user access level case by case. Feel free to :doc:`contact support </help/index>` explaining why would you need full access and what do you plan to do with it.
Due to the limited amount of resources, the team will carefully study your request before granting you full access.
