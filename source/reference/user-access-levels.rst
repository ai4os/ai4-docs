User access levels
==================

Currently we offer two user access levels, depending how you enrol with the platform yoy
can have access to different services.

In either case you will need to wait until you are **approved** before being able to
start using the services.

.. _authentication_basic:

Basic access level
------------------

This level will let use some basic features like:

* :doc:`Try a model in the Dashboard </howtos/try/index>`
* :doc:`Deploy a model in your own cloud </howtos/deploy/cloud>`

To access this authentication level, you need to create an account in the platform.
Please follow the steps in the :doc:`/getting-started/register` page.

.. _authentication_full:

Full access level
------------------

This access level will let use all the features the AI4OS stack has to offer, including:

* :doc:`Developing a model in the Dashboard </howtos/develop/index>`
* :doc:`Training a model in the Dashboard </howtos/train/index>`
* :doc:`Deploying a model in production </howtos/deploy/index>`
* :doc:`Accessing the AI4OS storage </reference/storage>`

To access this authentication level, you need to be a `member` of either one of the following
projects:

* `AI4EOSC <https://ai4eosc.eu/>`__: AI for the European Open Science Cloud
* `iMagine <https://imagine-ai.eu/>`__: Imaging data and services for aquatic science
* `AI4Life <https://ai4life.eurobioimaging.eu/>`__: AI models and methods for the life sciences

.. admonition:: External users
   :class: info

   If you are not a member of the above projects, consider joining either one of them
   by applying to the *Open calls for external usecases*.
   More information about the Calls can be found in their respective project's homepages.

   If you were not able to apply in time to an Open Call, you can always try to `reach us <https://ai4eosc.eu/contact/>`__
   explaining why and how you would like to use the platform.

To achieve full authentication, you need to create an account in the platform. Please
follow the steps in the :doc:`/getting-started/register` page and indicate the project
you are involved with, with a detailed motivation so that it can be approved.
