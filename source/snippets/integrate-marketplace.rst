Once your repo is set, it's time to integrate it in the :ref:`Marketplace <dashboard_marketplace>`!

For this the steps are:

1. `Open an issue <https://github.com/ai4os-hub/modules-catalog/issues/new>`__ in the `AI4OS Catalog repo <https://github.com/ai4os-hub/modules-catalog>`__.
2. An admin will create the Github repo for your module inside the `ai4os-hub organization <https://github.com/ai4os-hub>`__.
   You will be granted ``write`` permissions in that repo.

   Modules repos follow the following convention:

   * ``ai4os-hub/ai4-<project-name>``: module officially developed by the project
   * ``ai4os-hub/<project-name>``: modules developed by external users
3. Upload your code to that repo.
4. An admin will review your code and add it to the AI4OS Catalog.
   Once a module is approved it will take roughly 6 hours to appear in the Dashboard's Marketplace.
