Deploy a model on your own cloud resources
==========================================

As every module available in the Marketplace is open-source, we offer the possibility
to automatically deploy it in your custom cloud resources using the
`EGI Infrastructure Manager <https://im.egi.eu>`__.
This feature is available to anyone with an :ref:`EGI Check-In account <user/overview/auth:Basic authentication>`.

For this, :ref:`select a module in the Marketplace <user/overview/dashboard:Navigating the Marketplace>` and click on ``Deploy ▼ IM``.

This will forward you to the Infrastructure Manager, where you will be able to
select your own cloud resources to deploy.
