Try a model
^^^^^^^^^^^

You can try the model in two ways. The easiest way is to use the Dashboard, which
provides a short-lived web UI for interacting with the model. Alternatively, you can run
the model locally on your own resources.

.. grid:: 1
    :gutter: 3

    .. grid-item-card::  Try via the Dashboard (Gradio)
        :link: dashboard-gradio
        :link-type: doc

        Use our short-lived web UI to interact with the model. Batteries included, no
        installation needed.

    .. grid-item-card::  Try locally
        :link: locally
        :link-type: doc

        Run the model on your own resources. Requires Docker to handle the
        model container, and manual execution of the model.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :titlesonly:
   :hidden:

   Try with the Dashboard (Gradio) <dashboard-gradio>
   Try locally <locally>
