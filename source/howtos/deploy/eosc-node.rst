Deploy a model on the ESOC EU Node
==================================

   :class: info

   üîí This tutorial requires access to the EOSC EU Node and the usage of available credits in your account. `More information <https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/>`__.

This tutorial summarizes how to deploy a pre-trained AI model from the AI4EOSC Marketplace in the EOSC EU Node to be used for inference via the DEEPaaS API. For this, we will use the Tools Hub functionality of the EOSC EU Node, which allows us to deploy customized virtual infrastructures via TOSCA Templates on the available Cloud resources.

The Tools Hub provides a catalog of TOSCA templates for the Application Workflow Manager (based on the `Infrastructure Manager <https://im.egi.eu/>`__ technology) to deploy customized virtual infrastructures on the available Cloud resources. Two kind of deployments are supported in the EOSC EU Node: *Virtual Machines* (VMs), which run on OpenStack-based Clouds and *containers*, which run on managed OKD-based platforms. Let's analyze both options in the next tables.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - ‚úÖ VMs Pros
      - ‚ùå VMs Cons
    * - - You can login via SSH to the VM and, therefore, have full access to the execution environment.
      - - Longer deployment time,
        - Endpoint exposed in an IP, without a DNS name.

    :header-rows: 1

    * - ‚úÖ Containers Pros
      - ‚ùå Containers Cons
    * - - Fast deployment times,
        - Endpoint exposed in a DNS name.
      - - Managed platform, no access to the execution environment.

This page describes the procedures to support both approaches. It also includes the instructions to register an AI4EOSC Model as a tool in the EOSC EU Node and the instructions on how to deploy those previously registered tools to be used for AI inference in the resources of the EOSC EU Node. 

1. Procedure to Register the AI4EOSC Model as a Tool in the EOSC EU Node
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 0. Create the TOSCA template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There has to be a TOSCA Template for each AI4EOSC Model to be deployed. The TOSCA template depends on the kind of resources you want to deploy the model (VM or container). You can find two examples here:

 * `TOSCA VM example <https://github.com/grycap/tosca/blob/eosc_lot1/templates/ai4eoscvm.yaml>`__. 
 * `TOSCA Container example <https://github.com/grycap/tosca/blob/eosc_lot1/templates/ai4eosc_app.yaml>`__.  

Step 1. Register the TOSCA template in the Tools Hub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create a new Tool inside the ‚ÄúTools Hub‚Äù section of the EOSC EU Node portal.

.. image:: /_static/images/eoscnode/register-tool.png

Fill the form and register the tool. Once registered, you can make it public and share it among the community. Notice the TOSCA Template needs to undergo a security assessment before it appears in the public catalog of Tools. This security assessment is periodically reassessed.


2. Procedure to Deploy the Model in a Virtual Machine in the EOSC EU Node
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The next subsections are a tutorial to learn how to deploy an AI model of the AI4EOSC Marketplace in the EOSC EU Node. You can see a video demo `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1232s6kfq2jcDnTv_kMv7rC1Zx1Axb7GX/view?resourcekey>`__.


Step 0. Log into the EOSC EU Node and allocate the computing resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by logging in to the EOSC EU Node `here <https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/>`__.
Then, you need to allocate your Virtual Machine. Go to the **Virtual Machines** section for that. We reccomend you to choose a *Small* VM.
What happens underneeth is that OpenStack creates the corresponding project with the selected quota for your user. This is called your ‚ÄúDefault Personal Project‚Äù.
Allocate the environment by clicking the ``Run`` button.

.. image:: /_static/images/eoscnode/allocate-vms.png

Notice that in this step what you do is to allocate the resources (quota), but you are not actually deploying them. 

Step 1. Choose the tool to deploy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now, go to the Tools Hub and select the Tool from the ‚ÄúAll Tools‚Äù section. You can use the searcher to find the AI4EOSC tools already created. If you want, you can flag them as favourite. 

.. image:: /_static/images/eoscnode/tools-hub.png

Choose the desired tool. You can see the details with the "Show details" button.

.. image:: /_static/images/eoscnode/tools-details.png

Step 2. Deploy the tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deploy the desired tool by using the :material-outlined:`play;1.5em` ``Play`` button. 
You can set custom input values by clicking on the ‚Äúcustomize input values and save to new tool‚Äù checkbox. This enables the modification of the AI4EOSC model to deploy and the amount of computational resources to assing to the VM. So this is the way to easily deploy any of the AI models available in the marketplace.
If selected, the next fields appear:

.. image:: /_static/images/eoscnode/tool-custom.png

Modify them as desired and then click on the "Save and Select Project" button. It will create a new tool in your private ‚ÄúMy Tools‚Äù list, that you can use for new deployments.
Next, you need to select the Default Personal Project created in Step 0, which is linked to the allocated OpenStack project.

.. image:: /_static/images/eoscnode/tools-deploy.png

Press the ‚ÄúProceed‚Äù blue button and you will get a confirmation message about the deployment.
Once deployed, in the ‚ÄúDeployments‚Äù tab (inside the Tools Hub), it will appear a new entry corresponding with your new Deployment.


Step 3. Access the tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will see the endpoint of the deployed tool in the additional information option.

.. image:: /_static/images/eoscnode/tool-output.png

For the AI4EOSC AI models, if you access the endpoint provided, you will get a Swagger interface to use the model.
Please note that, in the case of Virtual Machines, it will take up to 10 minutes to deploy and configure the VM for the endpoint to be ready.  You can periodically try to connect until you‚Äôll eventually have access to the Swagger DEEPaaS UI.

Step 4. Using the tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



3. Procedure to Deploy the Model in a Container in the EOSC EU Node
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 0. Log into the EOSC EU Node and allocate the computing resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case of **Containers**, OKD reserves the corresponding quota for your user. In the **Cloud Container Platform** section, chose the *Small* environment and click ``Run``. You will have to choose the time period and press *Submit*.

Step 1. Choose the tool to deploy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
