Deploy a model on the ESOC EU Node
==================================

   :class: info

   üîí This tutorial requires access to the EOSC EU Node and the usage of available credits in your account. `More information <https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/>`__.

This tutorial summarizes how to deploy a pre-trained AI model from the AI4EOSC Marketplace in the EOSC EU Node to be used for inference via the DEEPaaS API. For this, we will use the Tools Hub functionality of the EOSC EU Node, which allows us to deploy customized virtual infrastructures via TOSCA Templates on the available Cloud resources.

The Tools Hub provides a catalog of TOSCA templates for the Application Workflow Manager (based on the `Infrastructure Manager <https://im.egi.eu/>`__ technology) to deploy customized virtual infrastructures on the available Cloud resources. Two kind of deployments are supported in the EOSC EU Node: *Virtual Machines* (VMs), which run on OpenStack-based Clouds and *containers*, which run on managed OKD-based platforms. Let's analyze both options in the next tables.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - ‚úÖ VMs Pros
      - ‚ùå VMs Cons
    * - - You can login via SSH to the VM and, therefore, have full access to the execution environment.
      - - Longer deployment time,
        - Endpoint exposed in an IP, without a DNS name.


.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - ‚úÖ Containers Pros
      - ‚ùå Containers Cons
    * - - Fast deployment times,
        - Endpoint exposed in a DNS name.
      - - Managed platform, no access to the execution environment.

This page describes the procedures to support both approaches. It also includes the instructions to register an AI4EOSC Model as a tool in the EOSC EU Node and the instructions on how to deploy those previously registered tools to be used for AI inference in the resources of the EOSC EU Node. 

1. Procedure to Register the AI4EOSC Model as a Tool in the EOSC EU Node
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 0. Create the TOSCA template
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There has to be a TOSCA Template for each AI4EOSC Model to be deployed. The TOSCA template depends on the kind of resources you want to deploy the model (VM or container). You can find two examples here:

 * `TOSCA VM example <https://github.com/grycap/tosca/blob/eosc_lot1/templates/ai4eoscvm.yaml>`__. 
 * `TOSCA Container example <https://github.com/grycap/tosca/blob/eosc_lot1/templates/ai4eosc_app.yaml>`__.  

Step 1. Register the TOSCA template in the Tools Hub
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Create a new Tool inside the ‚ÄúTools Hub‚Äù section of the EOSC EU Node portal.

.. image:: /_static/images/eoscnode/register-tool.png

Fill the form and register the tool. Once registered, you can make it public and share it among the community. Notice the TOSCA Template needs to undergo a security assessment before it appears in the public catalog of Tools. This security assessment is periodically reassessed.


2. Procedure to Deploy the Model in a Virtual Machine in the EOSC EU Node
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 0. Log into the EOSC EU Node and allocate the computing resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Start by logging in to the EOSC EU Node `here <https://open-science-cloud.ec.europa.eu/>`__.
Then, you need to allocate your Virtual Machine. Go to the **Virtual Machines** section for that. We reccomend you to choose a *Small* VM.
What happens underneeth is that OpenStack creates the corresponding project with the selected quota for your user. This is called your ‚ÄúDefault Personal Project‚Äù.
Allocate the environment by clicking the ``Run`` button.

Notice that in this step what you do is to allocate the resources (quota), but you are not actually deploying them. 

Step 1. Choose the tool to deploy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose the tool. You can see the details with the button.

Step 2. Deploy the tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deploy the desired tool by using the :material-outlined:`play;1.5em` ``Play`` button. 
You need to select the Default Personal Project created in Step 0.
Once deployed, in the ‚ÄúDeployments‚Äù tab, it will appear a new entry.


Step 3. Access the tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will see the endpoint of the deployed tool in additional information.
For the AI4EOSC AI models, you will get a Swagger interface to use the model.

You can see a demo `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1232s6kfq2jcDnTv_kMv7rC1Zx1Axb7GX/view?resourcekey>`__.


3. Procedure to Deploy the Model in a Container in the EOSC EU Node
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 0. Log into the EOSC EU Node and allocate the computing resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case of **Containers**, OKD reserves the corresponding quota for your user. In the **Cloud Container Platform** section, chose the *Small* environment and click ``Run``. You will have to choose the time period and press *Submit*.

Step 1. Choose the tool to deploy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
