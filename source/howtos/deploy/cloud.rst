==========================================

   üîì This tutorial requires :ref:`basic authentication <getting-started/register:Basic authentication>`.

As every module available in the Marketplace is open-source, we offer the possibility
to automatically deploy it in your custom cloud resources using the
`EGI Infrastructure Manager <https://im.egi.eu>`__.
This feature is available to any registered user (:doc:`/reference/user-access-levels`).

    * - ‚úÖ Pros
      - ‚ùå Cons
    * - - You control where you deploy (no need to be an AI4OS member).
      - - More work to configure the deployment,
        - You are consuming resources even when not actively making predictions (if not deployed as serverless).

For this, :ref:`select a module in the Marketplace <dashboard_marketplace>` and click on ``Deploy ‚ñº IM``.

This will forward you to the Infrastructure Manager, where you will be able to
select your own cloud resources to deploy.
