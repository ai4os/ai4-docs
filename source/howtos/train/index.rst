Train a model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section will guide you through the process of training a model with the Dashboard,
and some other aspects that influence the training process, like labeling your images
with CVAT, or using rclone to sync your dataset. Also, you will learn how to make a
federated learning training.
