Labeling images with CVAT
=========================

.. admonition:: Requirements
   :class: info

   ðŸ”’ This tutorial requires :ref:`full authentication <getting-started/register:Full authentication>`.

In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to use the `Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) <https://www.cvat.ai/>`__ in the AI4OS platform to annotate images.

Deploying CVAT
--------------

The CVAT tool is located at the top of the :ref:`Marketplace <dashboard_marketplace>`, in the ``Tools`` section.

The workflow for deploying CVAT is similar to the one for :doc:`deploying a module </reference/dashboard>`.
In this particular case, you will need to pay attention to:

* **CVAT credentials**:
  When configuring the deployment of CVAT, you will need to enter your ``CVAT username``  and ``CVAT password`` to authenticate yourself in the CVAT instance.

* **Storage**:
  For using CVAT, it is *mandatory* to have a :ref:`storage provider linked <dashboard_profile>`.
  This is because, each time you delete a CVAT instance a snapshot will automatically be created in your storage.
  When you deploy a new CVAT instance, you can either start from an existing snapshot or from a blank state (no snapshot).

Using CVAT
----------

In the :ref:`deployments list <dashboard-manage-deployments>` you will be able to see your newly created CVAT instance.
Clicking the ``Quick access`` button, you will directly enter the CVAT UI.
