Federated Learning with NVFLARE
===============================

   :class: info

   ðŸ”’ This tutorial requires :ref:`full authentication <getting-started/register:Full authentication>`.

In this tutorial, we will guide you on how to use the Federated Learning (FL) server in the
AI4OS platform to perform a FL training with `NVFLARE <https://developer.nvidia.com/flare>`__.

For more information, see the *Getting Started* step by step guide available in the
`federated server repository <https://github.com/deephdc/federated-server>`__, as well
as the tutorial on `using Federated Learning within the AI4OS Platform <https://youtu.be/FrgVummLNbU>`__.


Deploying a Federated server
----------------------------

The workflow for deploying a FL server is similar to the one for
:doc:`deploying a module </reference/dashboard>`.

In this particular case, you will need to pay attention to:

* Your credentials to access the NVFLARE Dashboard and associated Jupyter notebook.

* Whether to make the project public or restrict the training to authorized trusted partners.

* The Docker image that the client need to use to connect to the server.

* The start and end dates of the training
