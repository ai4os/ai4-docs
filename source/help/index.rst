Support
-------

Do you have problems using the platform? Are you interested in the project and want more
information?

There are several ways to contact us:

* `Open a ticket in our HelpDesk <https://helpdesk.services.ai4os.eu/>`__: this is the :material-outlined:`verified;1.5em` **recommended option** as it ensures that the relevant group of people can quickly address you requests. We handle both issues with the platform as well as new user requests to use the platform,
* `Write to a mailing list <mailto:ai4eosc-support@listas.csic.es>`__, although due to the the general purpose nature of the requests, replies might take longer

Remember that some problems can be solved even without contacting us:

* We have a dedicated page for :doc:`Frequently Asked Questions </help/faq>`.
* You can also ask our :ref:`AI4OS Assistant <reference/llm:Ask questions about the documentation>`, which is a LLM that uses this documentation as a Knowledge Base to offer grounded responses to user questions (also :ref:`available from the Dashboard <reference/dashboard:Ask AI>`).
* We have a `status page <https://status.ai4eosc.eu/>`__ where you can see whether a particular service might be down.
* We have a :ref:`notifications section <reference/dashboard:profile>` in the Dashboard where we notify users of expected downtimes and issues.

Finally we have an `AI4EOSC community <https://community.cloud.ai4eosc.eu/>`__. In contrast to the Helpdesk (more focused on specific technical problems), the AI4EOSC community allows users to share their experiences, ask questions to other members, requests new features, interact with developers, etc. Give it a try!

Puzzled on some acronyms? Please, have a look in our :doc:`Glossary </help/glossary>`.
