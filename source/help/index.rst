Support
-------

Do you have problems using the platform? Are you interested in the project and want more
information?

There are several ways to contact us:

* `Open a ticket in our HelpDesk <https://helpdesk.services.ai4os.eu/>`__: this is the :material-outlined:`verified;1.5em` **recommended option** as it ensures that the relevant group of people can quickly address you requests,
* `Write to a mailing list <mailto:ai4eosc-support@listas.csic.es>`__, although due to the the general purpose nature of the requests, replies might take longer

Remember that some problems can be solved even without contacting us:

* We have a dedicated page for :doc:`Frequently Asked Questions </help/faq>`.
* You can also ask our :ref:`AI4OS Assistant <reference/llm:Ask questions about the documentation>`, which is a LLM that uses this documentation as a Knowledge Base to offer grounded responses to user questions.
* We have a `status page <https://status.ai4eosc.eu/>`__ where you can see whether a particular service might be down.
* We have a :ref:`notifications section <reference/dashboard:profile>` in the Dashboard where we notify users of expected downtimes and issues.
