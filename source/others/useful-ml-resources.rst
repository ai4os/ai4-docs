Model development
-----------------

If you want to develop a model from scratch don't try to be a hero!
`Papers with Code <https://paperswithcode.com/>`__ gathers top performing models
for multiple tasks with their corresponding code. Reuse them for your usecases! Try not to look
for the top model but for the one with the cleanest code.

If you want nevertheless develop your model from scratch here are some recommendations.
