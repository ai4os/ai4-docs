Please, before the PR review, build the documentation and fix the warnings that
may have arisen from your modifications (some warnings might be unrelated to your
modifications though):

```bash
cd ai4-docs
make hmtl

# /***.rst:33: WARNING: blabla
# /***.rst:36: WARNING: blabla
```

If you upload new images as part of your modifications, make sure
[to compress them](https://www.iloveimg.com/compress-image/compress-png).

When you feel your PR is ready, tag [IgnacioHeredia](https://github.com/IgnacioHeredia)
as a reviewer.
